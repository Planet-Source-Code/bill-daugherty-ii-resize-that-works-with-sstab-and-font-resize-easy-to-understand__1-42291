A nice thing about this code, It is very easy to understand.

Please note: I have received this code from a friend who has received this code from another friend, they both have extensively edited it and no one knows who the original program was of this. If that is you please let us know so we can give you credit for it. However I do know that everyone can use this code and it is free for your use…

As your window resizes your controls resize and re-position...
